# Prediction of Heart Disease

Heart disease is one of the leading cause of death in the Unites States. The Dataset I have used is available in the UCI, Machine Learning Repository (This is also available in Kaggle). 

First I did my research on the Dataset using Tableau [ tableau link here ](https://public.tableau.com/profile/prebitha.staphney.abraham#!/vizhome/HeartDiseaseDatasetStudy/cardiaccatheterization?publish=yes)
